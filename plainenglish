// the food lists need to be added to the
// greengrocers sections with their images
// i'd suspect adding a ul to the header section
// and then add the groceries into that

// pull images from the assets folder ^^

// my items lists ( grocers that can be purchased) will need to be scrollable
// in order to be able to view them all.
//

// write a function to check through the items in the cart
// and if there are there already then add to their quantity
// a user should be able to adjust quantity from the cart.
// If the items quantity = 0 then it should be removed from
// "your cart" section.

// there should a running total of all the
// items in the cart and the total cost of each item.
